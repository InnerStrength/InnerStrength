- Hi, I’m @InnerStrength I've just recently started back on this big programming journey
- I’m well versed in html, css, and JS; I'm highly interested in Python, Java, and machine learning
- I’m currently solely focusing on Python, as to not bog down my mind with too much syntax and such
- I’m looking to collaborate on Python projects of increasing difficulty
- Initially this git will be for showcasing and saving my projects that I'm developing in my course, eventually I would like to 
-   be more active in the developing community
- You can reach me at patrickngp@gmail.com, here or my LinkedIn https://www.linkedin.com/mwlite/in/patrick-tonkinson-72a72556
